# Project Report

## Challenges Faced

### Challenge 1: API Limiting
**Problem:** Open AI API required you to pay
**Solution:** Paid 5$
**Learning:** Money can solve problems

### Challenge 2: Error Handling
**Problem:** JUnit run configure errors, the configure always run in Maven instead of Main file
**Solution:** Uncheck the 'Delegate IDE build run to Maven'


## Testing Strategy
Describe your testing approach and coverage.

## Design Pattern Justifications
**Strategy Pattern:** Needed different AI behaviors (creative, professional, academic)
**Factory Pattern:** Creating different request types cleanly
**Observer Pattern:** 

## AI/LLM Usage Disclosure
**Did you use AI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.)?**
Ruiyang used Claude to debug JUnit configure error
Asked: Why I can't run directly in file and keep getting maven exec:exec error
Modeified: Changed their suggestion to fit my error handler
Verified: Run successfully with Main.

## Time Spent: 

## What We Learned
- OOP concept reinforced
- API integration insights
- Design pattern understanding

## If We Had More Time
Features/improvements we'd add.
